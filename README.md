This project is a full-stack Flutter + Node.js + PostgreSQL application.
It lets you:

Render HTML pages inside a Flutter app.

Store and manage comments per page in PostgreSQL.

Manage backend APIs with Express.js.

PostgreSQL used as the database (hosted on Render).

Database schema:

pages â†’ stores page slug, title, HTML content.

ðŸ”¹ CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

A GitHub Actions workflow is configured to:

Run on push and pull_request events.

Install Flutter dependencies.

Run analyzer + tests.

(Optional) Build release APK when merging into main.

Example Workflow (.github/workflows/flutter.yml)
name: Flutter CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: ["*"]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      - name: Analyze
        run: flutter analyze

      - name: Run tests
        run: flutter test

      # Build release APK on main
